In this project we are going to build a natural language processing model to predict if the restaurant review is positive or negative.

## Code and Resources Used

* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, Natural Language Toolkit, Regular expression

## Data Handling

* Importing the libraries
* Importing the dataset
* Cleaning the texts
* Creating the Bag of Words model
* Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
* Training the Naive Bayes model on the Training set
* Predicting the Test set results
* Evaluate performance

## Conclusion

Based on text alone we correctly classified reviews as positive or negative 73% of the time.
